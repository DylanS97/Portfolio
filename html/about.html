                <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Dylan Stevenson and I am from Manchester. 
                    I have always had a passion for electronics and computers and I spent my teen years, taking apart phones, 
                    consoles, controllers and any other electronics which were broken so I could see how they work. 
                    I enjoyed taking them apart and learning how to put them back together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While researching how to fix the household electronics, 
                    I started to come across computer programming videos and I found these fascinating. 
                    I started to learn programming in my spare time during 2019. I started by learning C# and produced a 
                    few simple projects in my spare time such as an Investment Calculator that would take your monthly investments, 
                    your average dividends per year, and how many years you want to calculate for. 
                    It would then work out how much you would have invested at the end of each year and 
                    display the results to the console. I also produced a binary converter that would 
                    take a binary number as input and then print the decimal value to the console.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I then came across a free online course from Harvard by the name of 
                    <a href="https://stage-edx-prospectus.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x" target="_blank">
                        Introduction to Computer Science
                    </a> 
                    where I developed skills in C, Python and basic skills in HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I knew I wanted to turn this into my career so when I came across Netmatters at the start of 2021 
                    and was able to get accepted onto the SCS course I was excited to get started. 
                    It is here that I developed a much better understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and 
                    also gained new skills in PHP and Laravel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I’m not coding I like to play video games with friends where I can relax and have a laugh. 
                    I also enjoy reading, some of the genres I enjoy are Physics, Astronomy, and Mythologies such as Greek Mythology.
                </p>
            </div>
            <hr>
            <div class="second">
                <h1>My Goals</h1>
                <p>
                    My current goals are to achieve a career in back-end development and develop my skills further in PHP and 
                    Laravel because I enjoy problem solving and trying to find new ways of getting around things. 
                    I also like the way PHP and Laravel work together to make a webpage dynamic and 
                    I want to try and learn everything that can be done with the two.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually, it is a dream to venture into machine learning and game development when 
                    I get more competent with the languages and frameworks I am currently learning and 
                    have been able to get some years’ experience within the software development industry.
